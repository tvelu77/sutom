# SUTOM by Thomas VELU

SUTOM is a game where you have 6 tries to find the correct word.  
SUTOM is heavily inspired by a French television show called 
[Motus](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motus_(jeu_t%C3%A9l%C3%A9vis%C3%A9))
([Lingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingo_(American_game_show)) for the English version).
